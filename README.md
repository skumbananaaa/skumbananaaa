### Hi

My name is Herman, I'm a student at BTH in Karlskrona, Sweden, currently studying for a Master of Science in Game- and Software Development.

My current core programming interest is 3D-rendering with focus on light transportation, ray tracing and render pipeline automatization. I've had these interests since the start of a school project in Spring 2020. The project was a 3D-rendering application with focus testing different ray tracing capabilities in Vulkan, see [VulkanBoys](https://github.com/TheoBerlin/VulkanBoys).

This project had me research different ray tracing techniques for simulation light transportation, the cooler ones I tried were Irradiance Probes and Path Tracing with Spatio-Temporal Denoising. Although my understanding of these topics were lacking during the project so the results where subpar to say the least.

After this, me and two friends started another project which was meant to be used later on as a base for a bigger game development project, see [LambdaEngine](https://github.com/Mumsfilibaba/LambdaEngine). For the better of summer 2020 I expanded this engine, I implemented a RenderGraph to make testing different light transportation techniques less of a hassle. I also implemented a physically based Path Tracer with support for Area Lights. 

This engine then became the base for the current school project that I'm working on [CrazyCanvas](https://github.com/IbexOmega/CrazyCanvas). And that about explains how I got where I am now.

Other projects that I've worked on throughout the years:
* [Small Game Project](https://github.com/skumbananaaa/Litet-Spelprojekt) was a course where we developed a ship crisis simulator game using OpenGL.
* [3D-Programming Project](https://hermanoo.visualstudio.com/3D-Programmering) was my first introduction to 3D programming, where I developed a rendering application using OpenGL. Techniques include but are not limited to: PBR based lighting with IBL and Spotlights, Shadowmapping Multiple lights, Displacement mapping using tesselation, Parallax mapping, custom OBJ loading.
* [CUDA Net](https://hermanoo.visualstudio.com/CUDA_Net%203.0) was a project where I experimented with CUDA and tried to make a Neural Net which utilized it.
* [Space Shooter](https://hermanoo.visualstudio.com/DV1497%20Space%20Shooter) was one of the first Game Development project that I made at BTH.
